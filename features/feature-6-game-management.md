# Feature: Game Management

**Feature ID:** 6
**Branch pattern:** `feature/6-game-management`
**Status:** Ready
**Created:** 2026-09-22
**Input:** Signed-in admin users maintain a shared game catalog on one screen; new games are added via a dialog. A game has a season, date, start time, location, home team, visiting team, home team score, and visiting team score. A team has many games.
**Depends on:** [Feature 1 — User Authentication](feature-1-user-auth.md), [Feature 2 — Season Management](feature-2-season-management.md), [Feature 3 — League Management](feature-3-league-management.md), [Feature 5 — Team Management](feature-5-team-management.md)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All game endpoints MUST require a valid session (`authenticate`). `GET` MUST be allowed for any authenticated role. `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` MUST require `req.user.role` equal to `admin`.
- **FR-002**: Games MUST be a **shared catalog**. The `games` table MUST NOT include `userId`. The API MUST ignore any client-supplied ownership `userId`.
- **FR-003**: Authenticated non-admin users (including `student`) MUST receive `403` with `{ "message": "Admin role required." }` on `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. `GET` MUST return `200` for any authenticated user. They MUST NOT see **Games** in `MenuBar`.
- **FR-004**: Required game fields MUST be present and trimmed; empty or whitespace-only values MUST be rejected (client block and/or `400`). Required fields are `seasonId`, `gameDate`, `startTime`, `homeTeamId`, and `visitingTeamId`. `location` is not required on create.
- **FR-005**: Unauthenticated game API requests MUST return `401`. Unauthenticated navigation to `/games` MUST redirect to `login`.
- **FR-006**: Games MUST be ordered by `gameDate`, then `startTime`, in API responses.
- **FR-007**: This feature MUST deliver admin game CRUD and a **single-view** game UI in `Games.vue` (dialog-based add/edit/delete). No sidebar/main split.
- **FR-008**: `seasonId` MUST be a required integer that exists in `seasons`. Missing season message: **"Season not found."** (HTTP `400`). A season MAY have many games.
- **FR-009**: `homeTeamId` and `visitingTeamId` MUST be required integers that exist in `teams`. Missing team messages: **"Home team not found."**, **"Visiting team not found."** (HTTP `400`). They MUST be different. Same-team message: **"Home team and visiting team must be different."** Both teams MUST belong to the same league as the selected season. League-mismatch message: **"Home team and visiting team must be in the season's league."** A team MAY have many games (as home or visiting).
- **FR-010**: `gameDate` MUST be a required date. `startTime` MUST be a required time.
- **FR-011**: `location` MUST be optional. On create, omit it or store `null`. The **Edit Game** dialog MUST show **Location** so an admin can set or clear it. When present, `location` MUST be trimmed and at most 50 characters. Too-long message: **"Location must be 50 characters or fewer."** Empty or whitespace-only on edit MUST store `null`.
- **FR-012**: `homeTeamScore` and `visitingTeamScore` MAY be omitted or `null` (a scheduled game with no score yet). When present, each MUST be an integer from `0` through `999`. Invalid message: **"Score must be between 0 and 999."**
- **FR-013**: `DELETE` of a season MUST fail with `400` when any game references that season. `DELETE` of a team MUST fail with `400` when any game uses that team as home or visiting. Do **not** cascade-delete games when a season or team is deleted. Messages: **"Cannot delete season: games still exist."**, **"Cannot delete team: games still exist."** The parent row and its games MUST remain stored.

---

## Assumptions

- Features 1–5 (auth/`MenuBar`, seasons, leagues, people, teams) MUST be merged to `dev` before implementing this feature.
- A user with role `admin` exists (Feature 1 `role`; tests may seed an admin).
- Tests MAY seed at least one league, one season, and two teams in that season's league before creating a game.
- A game belongs to one **Season**. Home and visiting teams belong to one **League** each. The season's `leagueId` is the league both teams MUST use.
- A team MAY appear in many games (home or visiting). A team MAY be home in one game and visiting in another.
- Scores are optional so a game can be scheduled before it is played.
- Add/Edit dialogs load seasons from `GET /league/seasons` and teams from `GET /league/teams`.
- Foreign keys from `games.seasonId`, `games.homeTeamId`, and `games.visitingTeamId` MUST use **RESTRICT**.
- This feature updates Feature 2 and Feature 5 `DELETE` handlers for `/league/seasons/:seasonId` and `/league/teams/:teamId` to enforce FR-013.
- Games use **dialog-based** workflows (no split sidebar / main panel).
- API mount for this resource is `/league/…`. Use `/league/games`.

## Edge Cases

- Empty or whitespace-only required field → client block; **"Required"**; no API call.
- `location` longer than 50 characters (edit) → **"Location must be 50 characters or fewer."**
- Unknown `seasonId` → `400` with `{ "message": "Season not found." }`
- Unknown `homeTeamId` → `400` with `{ "message": "Home team not found." }`
- Unknown `visitingTeamId` → `400` with `{ "message": "Visiting team not found." }`
- `homeTeamId` equals `visitingTeamId` → `400` with `{ "message": "Home team and visiting team must be different." }`
- Home or visiting team is not in the season's league → `400` with `{ "message": "Home team and visiting team must be in the season's league." }`
- Score present but not an integer 0–999 → **"Score must be between 0 and 999."**
- Scores omitted or `null` → allowed.
- Unknown `gameId` on PUT/DELETE → `404` with `{ "message": "Game with id=<id> not found." }`
- `DELETE` season while games still reference it → `400`; season and games remain.
- `DELETE` team while games still reference it as home or visiting → `400`; team and games remain.
- Authenticated `student` (or any non-admin) on `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE` → `403`.
- Authenticated `student` on `GET` → `200` with the shared catalog.
- Unauthenticated user on `/games` or `GET /league/games` → redirect or `401`.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: Every Gherkin scenario has at least one automated test before merge.
- **SC-002**: A signed-in admin can create, view, edit, and delete the shared game catalog on one screen.
- **SC-003**: A signed-in student MAY `GET` the game catalog; they cannot open the games manager and cannot mutate games via the API.
- **SC-004**: An admin cannot delete a season or team that still has games.
- **SC-005**: `npm test` passes for game API and games view behavior.

## Data Ownership & Isolation

Games are a **shared catalog**. They are not owned by the signed-in admin. Only role `admin` may manage them. Any authenticated user MAY `GET` the catalog. Role `student` does not see the manager UI.

| Rule               | Requirement                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Read scope**     | `GET /league/games` returns **all** games (with season, home team, and visiting team) to any authenticated user.        |
| **Write scope**    | `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are allowed only when `req.user.role` is `admin`.                                            |
| **Create scope**   | New games have no owner. Ignore ownership `userId` if sent in the body.                                                  |
| **Missing game**   | Unknown `gameId` → `404` with `{ "message": "Game with id=<id> not found." }`. Never use ownership `404` to hide rows.   |
| **Non-admin**      | Authenticated non-admin `GET` → `200`. `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE` → `403` with `{ "message": "Admin role required." }`.   |
| **UI scope**       | **Games** menu and `/games` are admin-only. Students do not see this manager.                                            |
| **Implementation** | Use `authenticate` on all endpoints. Use `requireAdmin` after `authenticate` on `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` only.        |

---

## API Requirements

| Method   | Endpoint                   | Auth       | Purpose                                |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/league/games`            | Yes        | Fetch all games with season and teams  |
| `POST`   | `/league/games`            | Yes, admin | Create a game                          |
| `PUT`    | `/league/games/:gameId`    | Yes, admin | Update a game                          |
| `DELETE` | `/league/games/:gameId`    | Yes, admin | Delete a game                          |

**Create game request body:**

```json
{
  "seasonId": 1,
  "gameDate": "2026-09-12",
  "startTime": "18:00",
  "location": "Memorial Field",
  "homeTeamId": 1,
  "visitingTeamId": 2,
  "homeTeamScore": null,
  "visitingTeamScore": null
}
```

Do not send `id` on create. Scores MAY be omitted.

**Update game request body:** same fields as create (no `id`).

**Game success response** (`200` / `201`):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "seasonId": 1,
  "gameDate": "2026-09-12",
  "startTime": "18:00:00",
  "location": "Memorial Field",
  "homeTeamId": 1,
  "visitingTeamId": 2,
  "homeTeamScore": null,
  "visitingTeamScore": null,
  "season": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "2026 Fall",
    "leagueId": 1
  },
  "homeTeam": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "OKC Strikers",
    "leagueId": 1
  },
  "visitingTeam": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Tulsa FC",
    "leagueId": 1
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`GET /league/games` returns an **array** of game objects in this shape.

**Error response:** `{ "message": "Human-readable explanation." }` with appropriate HTTP status.  
**Not found:** `404` for unknown `gameId`.  
**Missing parent / validation:** `400` (FR-008 / FR-009 / FR-011 / FR-012).

This feature also changes Feature 2 and Feature 5 delete APIs (FR-013): `DELETE /league/seasons/:seasonId` and `DELETE /league/teams/:teamId` MUST return `400` with the quoted FR-013 message when games still reference that row.

## Screen Requirements

### [View: Games] — route name `games` — path `/games` — `Games.vue`

- Heading: **Games**
- Primary action: **+ New game** (`oc-cta`) opens the **Add Game** `<v-dialog>`.
- **Add Game** fields:
  - **Season** (`v-select` of existing seasons from `GET /league/seasons`, display season `name`)
  - **Date** (`v-text-field` type date)
  - **Start Time** (`v-text-field` type time)
  - **Home Team** (`v-select` of existing teams from `GET /league/teams`, display team `name`)
  - **Visiting Team** (`v-select` of existing teams, display team `name`)
  - **Home Team Score** (`v-text-field` type number; optional)
  - **Visiting Team Score** (`v-text-field` type number; optional)
- **Edit Game** uses the same fields plus **Location** (`v-text-field`, optional, max 50), pre-filled.
- **Add Game** actions: **Create** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary `variant="text"` or `outlined`).
- List: `v-table` (or `v-list`); columns **date**, **start time**, **location**, **home team**, **visiting team**, **home score**, **visiting score**, and **season**; rows ordered by date then start time (FR-006).
- Icon-only row actions use `size="small"` and accessible `aria-label`s:
  - **Edit game** — opens **Edit Game** `<v-dialog>` pre-filled with current data; **Save Game** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary)
  - **Delete game** — opens **Delete Game** confirmation `<v-dialog>` with copy **"Delete this game?"**; **Delete Game** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary)
- Client-side validation: required fields use inline rules (`"Required"`); invalid submit does not send an API request.
- **Empty state:** **"No games yet. Create your first game."** when the catalog has zero games.
- **Loading state:** skeleton or progress indicator while games are fetching.
- **Error state:** `<v-alert type="error">` for API failures.
- Admin-only: **Games** menu item and `/games` are for signed-in admin users. Other roles do not see the **Games** item. Unauthenticated navigation to `/games` redirects to `login`.
- Game CRUD dialogs live in `Games.vue` (or child presentational dialogs). No sidebar/main split.

**App chrome**

- Use the `MenuBar` introduced in [Feature 1](feature-1-user-auth.md). Do **not** create a second `MenuBar`. Do **not** hide it on `login` / `register`.
- Add **Games** (allowed role `admin`; navigates to `/games`) to `MenuBar` after **Teams**. Menu order: **Leagues**, **Teams**, **Games**, **People**, **Seasons**.
- Students MUST NOT see **Games**.
- After login, the user remains on Feature 1 `home`. Selecting **Games** in the menu opens this feature's view.

---

## Key Entities

- **Game**: scheduled (and optionally scored) contest in one **Season** between a **home team** and a **visiting team**. Shared catalog row. Not owned by a user. A team may have many games.

## Agent implementation request

Copy when asking Cursor to implement this feature (`@` this file):

```text
Implement Feature 6 from @features/feature-6-game-management.md on branch `feature/6-game-management`.

Follow layer order in @features/framework.md (models → routes → backend tests → frontend → frontend tests).
Map every Gherkin scenario in the Test Coverage Map; run `npm test` before finishing.
If API routes, payloads, schema, or product rules changed per this spec, update @features/reference/api.md, @features/reference/data-model.md, and/or @features/reference/behavior.md in the same PR to match shipped code.
Complete Definition of Done and the merge checklist in @features/framework.md.
Do not implement behavior not in this spec.
```

**Reference updates for this feature:** `features/reference/data-model.md`, `features/reference/api.md`, `features/reference/behavior.md`

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Backend and frontend implemented per this spec (**FR-00N** satisfied)
- [x] **Success Criteria (SC-00N)** met
- [x] All mapped tests pass (`npm test`)
- [x] Test Coverage Map complete
- [x] `features/reference/data-model.md` updated (if schema changed)
- [x] `features/reference/api.md` updated (if API changed)
- [x] `features/reference/behavior.md` updated (if product rules changed)

---

## Out of Scope

- Student-facing game or scoreboard UI (API `GET` is in this feature)
- Standings, playoffs, or automatic ranking
- Officials, weather, or recap notes
- Creating seasons or teams from the add-game dialog
- Non-admin game management UI
- Creating `MenuBar` (introduced in [Feature 1](feature-1-user-auth.md); this feature only adds **Games** for role `admin`)

---

## Delivered to later features

- `MenuBar` is Feature 1 chrome; Features 2–5 added **Seasons**, **Leagues**, **People**, and **Teams**; this feature added **Games** for `admin`.
- A later feature MUST add its nav item to this `MenuBar`; it MUST NOT create a second `MenuBar`.
- The `games` table belongs to one season and two teams. A team has many games.
- [Feature 7](feature-7-season-view.md) lists a season's games on the season view and adds a game with that season already selected.
