# Feature: Team Management

**Feature ID:** 5
**Branch pattern:** `feature/5-team-management`
**Status:** Ready
**Created:** 2026-02-01
**Input:** Signed-in admin users manage a teams list and a team view. A team has a name, belongs to a league, and has players. The team view shows team info, **Edit team**, **Add Players**, and a player list. A player is a Feature 4 person on that team with a name, number, and position.
**Depends on:** [Feature 1 — User Authentication](feature-1-user-auth.md), [Feature 2 — Season Management](feature-2-season-management.md), [Feature 3 — League Management](feature-3-league-management.md), [Feature 4 — People Management](feature-4-people-management.md)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All team and player endpoints MUST require a valid session (`authenticate`). `GET` MUST be allowed for any authenticated role. `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` MUST require `req.user.role` equal to `admin`.
- **FR-002**: Teams and players MUST be a **shared catalog**. The `teams` and `players` tables MUST NOT use `userId` as ownership. The API MUST ignore any client-supplied ownership `userId`.
- **FR-003**: Authenticated non-admin users (including `student`) MUST receive `403` with `{ "message": "Admin role required." }` on `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. `GET` MUST return `200` for any authenticated user. They MUST NOT see **Teams** in `MenuBar`.
- **FR-004**: Required team and player fields MUST be present and trimmed; empty or whitespace-only values MUST be rejected (client block and/or `400`).
- **FR-005**: Unauthenticated team API requests MUST return `401`. Unauthenticated navigation to `/teams` or `/teams/:teamId` MUST redirect to `login`.
- **FR-006**: Teams MUST be ordered by related league `name`, then team `name`, in API responses. Players on a team MUST be ordered by `number`.
- **FR-007**: This feature MUST deliver a **teams list** in `Teams.vue` and a **team view** in `Team.vue`. The team view MUST have a heading area for team info, an **Edit team** button that opens the **Edit Team** dialog, an **Add Players** button that opens the **Add Player** dialog, and a player list (name, number, position) with an **Edit player** icon that opens the **Edit Player** dialog. Team and player mutations stay dialog-based. No sidebar/main split. Player management MUST NOT live inside the **Edit Team** dialog.
- **FR-008**: Team `name` MUST be required, trimmed, and at most 50 characters. Too-long message: **"Team name must be 50 characters or fewer."** The pair (`leagueId`, `name`) MUST be unique. Duplicate message: **"Team name is already taken in this league."** `homeField` MUST be required, trimmed, and at most 50 characters. Too-long message: **"Home field must be 50 characters or fewer."** `homeField` is the venue used as the game `location` when that team is home (Feature 6).
- **FR-009**: `leagueId` MUST be a required integer that exists in `leagues`. Missing league message: **"League not found."** (HTTP `400`). A league MAY have many teams.
- **FR-010**: A player MUST belong to one team and one Feature 4 person. `teamId` comes from the route. `personId` MUST be a required integer that exists in `people`. Missing person message: **"Person not found."** (HTTP `400`). The pair (`teamId`, `personId`) MUST be unique. Duplicate-person message: **"Person is already on this team."** A person MAY be on more than one team.
- **FR-011**: Player `position` MUST be required, trimmed, and at most 30 characters. Too-long message: **"Position must be 30 characters or fewer."**
- **FR-012**: Player `number` MUST be a required integer from `0` through `99`. Invalid message: **"Player number must be between 0 and 99."** The pair (`teamId`, `number`) MUST be unique. Duplicate-number message: **"Player number is already taken on this team."**
- **FR-013**: `DELETE` of a league MUST fail with `400` when any team references that league. `DELETE` of a person MUST fail with `400` when any player references that person. Do **not** cascade-delete teams when a league is deleted, and do **not** delete people when a player or team is deleted. Messages: **"Cannot delete league: teams still exist."**, **"Cannot delete person: team roster still exists."** The parent row and its dependents MUST remain stored. `DELETE` of a team MUST remove that team's player rows and MUST NOT delete the people.

---

## Assumptions

- Features 1–4 (auth/`MenuBar`, seasons, leagues, people) MUST be merged to `dev` before implementing this feature.
- A user with role `admin` exists (Feature 1 `role`; tests may seed an admin).
- Tests MAY seed at least one league and one person (from Features 3–4) before creating a team or player.
- Teams belong to a **league**, not to a season and not to a signed-in user. No FK from `teams` to `seasons`.
- A team MAY be created with an empty roster. Players are added in this feature.
- A **player** is a roster row (person + position + number on a team), not a second copy of the person.
- `position` is free text (not a closed list). Sports differ by league.
- Add/Edit dialogs load leagues from `GET /league/leagues` and people from `GET /league/people`.
- Foreign keys from `teams.leagueId` and `players.personId` MUST use **RESTRICT**. Foreign key from `players.teamId` MUST use **CASCADE** so deleting a team removes roster rows only.
- This feature updates Feature 3–4 `DELETE` handlers for `/league/leagues/:leagueId` and `/league/people/:personId` to enforce FR-013.
- The **teams list** creates and deletes teams. The **team view** edits one team and manages that team's players.
- Team and player forms use **dialog-based** workflows (no split sidebar / main panel).
- API mount for this resource is `/league/…`. Use `/league/teams`.

## Edge Cases

- Empty or whitespace-only required field → client block; **"Required"**; no API call.
- Team `name` longer than 50 characters → **"Team name must be 50 characters or fewer."**
- Duplicate team `name` in the same league → `400` with `{ "message": "Team name is already taken in this league." }`
- Same team name in a **different** league is allowed.
- Unknown `leagueId` → `400` with `{ "message": "League not found." }`
- Unknown `personId` → `400` with `{ "message": "Person not found." }`
- Person already on that team → `400` with `{ "message": "Person is already on this team." }`
- Same person on a **different** team is allowed.
- Player `number` outside 0–99 → **"Player number must be between 0 and 99."**
- Duplicate `number` on the same team → `400` with `{ "message": "Player number is already taken on this team." }`
- Same number on a **different** team is allowed.
- `position` longer than 30 characters → **"Position must be 30 characters or fewer."**
- Unknown `teamId` or `playerId` on PUT/DELETE → `404` with `{ "message": "Team with id=<id> not found." }` or `{ "message": "Player with id=<id> not found." }`
- `DELETE` league while teams still reference it → `400`; league and teams remain.
- `DELETE` person while a player still references them → `400`; person and player remain.
- `DELETE` team → team and its player rows are removed; people remain.
- Authenticated `student` (or any non-admin) on `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE` → `403`.
- Authenticated `student` on `GET` → `200`.
- Unauthenticated user on `/teams`, `/teams/:teamId`, or `GET /league/teams` → redirect or `401`.
- Unknown `teamId` on the team view → error **"Team with id=<id> not found."**

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: Every Gherkin scenario has at least one automated test before merge.
- **SC-002**: A signed-in admin can create and delete teams on the teams list, and edit a team from the team view.
- **SC-003**: A signed-in admin can open a team view and add or edit players (name, number, position) from that view.
- **SC-004**: A signed-in student MAY `GET` teams and players; they cannot open the teams manager and cannot mutate teams or players via the API.
- **SC-005**: An admin cannot delete a league that still has teams, or a person who is still on a roster.
- **SC-006**: `npm test` passes for team and player API and teams view behavior.

## Data Ownership & Isolation

Teams and players are a **shared catalog**. They are not owned by the signed-in admin. Only role `admin` may manage them. Any authenticated user MAY `GET` the catalog. Role `student` does not see the manager UI.

| Rule               | Requirement                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Read scope**     | `GET /league/teams` returns **all** teams (with league and players) to any authenticated user.                          |
| **Write scope**    | `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are allowed only when `req.user.role` is `admin`.                                            |
| **Create scope**   | New teams and players have no owner. Ignore ownership `userId` if sent in the body.                                      |
| **Missing team**   | Unknown `teamId` → `404` with `{ "message": "Team with id=<id> not found." }`. Never use ownership `404` to hide rows.   |
| **Missing player** | Unknown `playerId` → `404` with `{ "message": "Player with id=<id> not found." }`.                                        |
| **Non-admin**      | Authenticated non-admin `GET` → `200`. `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE` → `403` with `{ "message": "Admin role required." }`.   |
| **UI scope**       | **Teams** menu, `/teams`, and `/teams/:teamId` are admin-only. Students do not see this manager.                          |
| **Implementation** | Use `authenticate` on all endpoints. Use `requireAdmin` after `authenticate` on `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` only.        |

## API Requirements

| Method   | Endpoint                                      | Auth       | Purpose                                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/league/teams`                              | Yes        | Fetch all teams with league and players      |
| `POST`   | `/league/teams`                              | Yes, admin | Create a team in a league                    |
| `PUT`    | `/league/teams/:teamId`                      | Yes, admin | Update a team's name, league, or home field  |
| `DELETE` | `/league/teams/:teamId`                      | Yes, admin | Delete a team and its player rows            |
| `GET`    | `/league/teams/:teamId/players`              | Yes        | Fetch players on one team                    |
| `POST`   | `/league/teams/:teamId/players`              | Yes, admin | Add a player to a team                       |
| `PUT`    | `/league/teams/:teamId/players/:playerId`    | Yes, admin | Update a player's position or number         |
| `DELETE` | `/league/teams/:teamId/players/:playerId`    | Yes, admin | Remove a player from a team                  |

**Create team request body:**

```json
{
  "name": "OKC Strikers",
  "leagueId": 1,
  "homeField": "Memorial Field"
}
```

Do not send `id` on create. Players are **not** created in this body.

**Update team request body:** same fields as create (no `id`).

**Team success response** (`200` / `201`):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "OKC Strikers",
  "leagueId": 1,
  "homeField": "Memorial Field",
  "league": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "OKC Youth Soccer",
    "sport": "soccer"
  },
  "players": [],
  "createdAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`GET /league/teams` returns an **array** of team objects in this shape, including each team's `players` array.

**Create player request body:**

```json
{
  "personId": 1,
  "position": "Forward",
  "number": 10
}
```

**Update player request body:** `position` and `number` (and `personId` if changing the person). Do not send `teamId` in the body.

**Player success response** (`200` / `201`):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "teamId": 1,
  "personId": 1,
  "position": "Forward",
  "number": 10,
  "person": {
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Error response:** `{ "message": "Human-readable explanation." }` with appropriate HTTP status.  
**Not found:** `404` for unknown `teamId` / `playerId`.  
**Missing parent:** `400` (FR-009 / FR-010).

This feature also changes Feature 3–4 delete APIs (FR-013): `DELETE /league/leagues/:leagueId` and `DELETE /league/people/:personId` MUST return `400` with the quoted FR-013 message when teams or players still reference that row.

---

## Screen Requirements

### [View: Teams] — route name `teams` — path `/teams` — `Teams.vue`

- Heading: **Teams**
- Primary action: **+ New team** (`oc-cta`) opens the **Add Team** `<v-dialog>`.
- **Add Team** fields:
  - **Team Name** (`v-text-field`)
  - **League** (`v-select` of existing leagues, display league `name`)
  - **Home Field** (`v-text-field`)
- **Add Team** actions: **Create** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary `variant="text"` or `outlined`).
- List: `v-table` (or `v-list`); columns **team name**, **league**, and **players** (count); rows ordered by league name then team name (FR-006).
- Team name is plain text (not a link).
- Icon-only row actions use `size="small"` and accessible `aria-label`s:
  - **Open team** — team icon (`mdi-account-group`) navigates to the **Team** view (`/teams/:teamId`)
  - **Delete team** — opens **Delete Team** confirmation `<v-dialog>` with copy **"Delete this team?"**; **Delete Team** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary)
- Client-side validation: required fields use inline rules (`"Required"`); invalid submit does not send an API request.
- **Empty state:** **"No teams yet. Create your first team."** when the catalog has zero teams.
- **Loading state:** skeleton or progress indicator while teams are fetching.
- **Error state:** `<v-alert type="error">` for API failures.
- Admin-only: **Teams** menu item and `/teams` are for signed-in admin users. Other roles do not see the **Teams** item. Unauthenticated navigation to `/teams` redirects to `login`.

### [View: Team] — route name `team` — path `/teams/:teamId` — `Team.vue`

This is the team view (team main).

- **Heading area** shows team info: team **name**, **league** name (and sport if already on the nested `league` object), and **home field**.
- Actions in the heading area:
  - **Edit team** (`oc-cta`) opens the **Edit Team** `<v-dialog>` pre-filled with current name, league, and home field.
  - **Add Players** (`oc-cta`) opens the **Add Player** `<v-dialog>`.
- **Edit Team** fields (name, league, and home field — no player list in this dialog):
  - **Team Name** (`v-text-field`)
  - **League** (`v-select` of existing leagues, display league `name`)
  - **Home Field** (`v-text-field`)
- **Edit Team** actions: **Save Team** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary). After a successful save, the heading area shows the updated team info and the dialog closes.
- **Player list:** `v-table` (or `v-list`); columns **name** (person last name, first name), **number**, and **position**; rows ordered by `number` (FR-006).
- Each player row has an icon-only **Edit player** action (`size="small"`, `aria-label` **Edit player**) that opens the **Edit Player** `<v-dialog>` pre-filled with that player's person, number, and position.
- **Add Player** / **Edit Player** fields (same set; edit pre-filled):
  - **Person** (`v-select` of existing people, display last name, first name)
  - **Number** (`v-text-field` type number)
  - **Position** (`v-text-field`)
- **Add Player** actions: **Add** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary).
- **Edit Player** actions: **Save Player** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary).
- Each player row also has **Remove player** (existing US-5.8): confirmation **"Remove this player from the team?"**; **Remove Player** (`oc-cta`) / **Cancel** (secondary).
- Client-side validation: required fields use inline rules (`"Required"`); invalid submit does not send an API request.
- **Empty roster:** **"No players yet. Add the first player."** when the team has zero players.
- **Loading state:** skeleton or progress indicator while the team is fetching.
- **Error state:** `<v-alert type="error">` for API failures. Unknown `teamId` shows **"Team with id=<id> not found."**
- Admin-only: `/teams/:teamId` is for signed-in admin users. Unauthenticated navigation redirects to `login`.
- Team and player dialogs live in `Team.vue` (or child presentational dialogs). **Edit Team** MUST NOT contain the player list. No sidebar/main split.

**App chrome**

- Use the `MenuBar` introduced in [Feature 1](feature-1-user-auth.md). Do **not** create a second `MenuBar`. Do **not** hide it on `login` / `register`.
- Add **Teams** (allowed role `admin`; navigates to `/teams`) to `MenuBar`. Keep name, **Sign out**, **Seasons**, **Leagues**, and **People** from Features 1–4.
- Students MUST NOT see **Teams**.
- After login, the user remains on Feature 1 `home`. Selecting **Teams** in the menu opens the teams list. Opening a team from that list shows the team view.

---

## Key Entities

- **Team**: named roster that belongs to one **League**. Shared catalog row. Not owned by a user. A league may have many teams.
- **Player**: a **Person** on a **Team**, with a `position` and `number`. Not a second person record. Deleting a player or team does not delete the person.

## Agent implementation request

Copy when asking Cursor to implement this feature (`@` this file):

```text
Implement Feature 5 from @features/feature-5-team-management.md on branch `feature/5-team-management`.

Follow layer order in @features/framework.md (models → routes → backend tests → frontend → frontend tests).
Map every Gherkin scenario in the Test Coverage Map; run `npm test` before finishing.
If API routes, payloads, schema, or product rules changed per this spec, update @features/reference/api.md, @features/reference/data-model.md, and/or @features/reference/behavior.md in the same PR to match shipped code.
Complete Definition of Done and the merge checklist in @features/framework.md.
Do not implement behavior not in this spec.
```

**Reference updates for this feature:** `features/reference/data-model.md`, `features/reference/api.md`, `features/reference/behavior.md`

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Backend and frontend implemented per this spec (**FR-00N** satisfied)
- [ ] **Success Criteria (SC-00N)** met
- [ ] All mapped tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Test Coverage Map complete
- [ ] `features/reference/data-model.md` updated (if schema changed)
- [ ] `features/reference/api.md` updated (if API changed)
- [ ] `features/reference/behavior.md` updated (if product rules changed)

---

## Out of Scope

- Student-facing team or roster UI (API `GET` is in this feature)
- Assigning a team to a season
- Coaches, staff, or captains as separate roles
- A closed list of positions
- Creating people from the add-player dialog (people stay in [Feature 4](feature-4-people-management.md))
- Non-admin team management UI
- Creating `MenuBar` (introduced in [Feature 1](feature-1-user-auth.md); this feature only adds **Teams** for role `admin`)

---

## Delivered to later features

- `MenuBar` is Feature 1 chrome; Features 2–4 added **Seasons**, **Leagues**, and **People**; this feature added **Teams** for `admin`.
- A later feature MUST add its nav item to this `MenuBar`; it MUST NOT create a second `MenuBar`.
- The `teams` table belongs to `leagues`. The `players` table attaches Feature 4 **people** to a team with position and number.
- [Feature 6](feature-6-game-management.md) attaches games to teams. A team MAY have many games. Feature 6 MUST reject `DELETE /league/teams/:teamId` with `400` when games still reference that team.
